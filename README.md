🟢 Zatus

A modern smart status and auto-reply app that automatically responds to messages or calls when you're busy — powered by Flutter + Firebase.

🚀 Overview
Zatus lets you set a custom “status” (e.g., *Busy*, *At the gym*, *Driving*) and automatically responds to messages or missed calls with your preset message.
The goal is to build a cross-platform AI-driven presence app — a modern replacement for outdated voicemail and DND systems.

🧩 MVP Features
✅ Set custom status message  
✅ Detect incoming messages (via Android Notification Listener)  
✅ Auto-reply using your current status  
✅ Log contacts who tried to reach you  
✅ Simple dashboard to review missed interactions  

🧠 Future Roadmap
- AI urgency detection (keyword & context-based)
- Smart call agent (voice response + transcription)
- Integration with WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack
- Calendar & driving mode sync
- Cloud-based sync between devices
